/**
 * amd free model — plugin entry (Host half).
 *
 * Wiring: one adapter instance, two provider routes (usable now / region-limited
 * Wire: one adapter, one provider route, a live-catalog + availability-probe loop behind it, the
 * browser-facing JSON API the settings page reads, and the OpenAI-compatible
 * forward listener.
 *
 * On top of the model lane the plugin owns a small distribution channel of its
 * own: a remote announcement feed the repository owner publishes by pushing a
 * JSON document, an in-app self-updater that verifies and installs new releases
 * from the same repository, and a self hot-reload that swaps the running plugin
 * for the code now on disk. All three report to the browser over one
 * Server-Sent-Events route, because the kernel has no notification service and
 * the settings page should not have to poll.
 *
 * Every harness facility is reached through `ctx`, and only the one the plugin
 * cannot exist without is declared in `inject`, so a composition that omits the
 * rest degrades a feature rather than failing the plugin: no web server means no
 * in-app dashboard, no attachments means image blocks fall back to the text
 * projection the runtime already performs. See `inject` below.

 *   throws rather than answering `undefined`.
 * - `connection`, `attachments` — one feature each: the fence falls back to its
 *   structural replica, image blocks to the text projection. Both are read with
 *   `ctx.get()`, which is the opportunistic lookup that answers `undefined`.
